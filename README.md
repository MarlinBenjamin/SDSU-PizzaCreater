            Over the last couple of weeks, we have been running through the tutorials for this final program. To begin, we started on the first day it was assigned by all individually looking over the rubric and instructions in order to figure out what to expect. Understanding that we were all occupied with other finals, we didn’t meet up to work on the assignment until a week or so after (4/23). That’s when we started to understand what we needed to download and proceeded to dedicate those days to some downloading, however due to the amount of other programs that each of us had going on in different courses, we didn’t start to code yet.

            This hyperlink is when the code was guaranteed to work, at least the webpage format and what we were going for in regards to the look and forms that were included. However, with some further modifications as we come closer to the finish, there may be some obstructions. So here’s the link just for the purpose of documentation.
            
Our database was having some difficulties, however we attempted to create one using Entity Framework. We had a hard time creating a new page for Entity Framework, however, as it would continue to pull up an error code. We have the forms created, but not necessarily a database to put it all into, unfortunately.
            
There was a modification that we attempted to create in the code that prevented the solution explorer to be updated. Thus, whenever we would try to input new code and update, there wouldn’t be any changes and errors would still be in our code. We became stuck and confused as to why our website wouldn’t respond to our changes no matter how we pulled/pushed. We used all the correct commands as well but there are still errors.

We tried to create authorization for the web app, but it didn’t work well for some reason. We couldn’t find the solution for our errors. Moreover, we had trouble with github, we had to  delete the old repository and create a new one.
